# Slab-Session2

At first, we have added our module "sum.py". We have committed our changes using this line:

git commit -m 'Add sum.py' -m 'This module is going be able to add two numbers and show the result to the user'

After that, we have updated 'README.md',and committed our changes using this line:

git commit -m 'Update README.md' -m 'New information has been added to README'

Next, we make branch main protected, and we make a new branch named dev.
